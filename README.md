# Sentinel-Mosaic

Sentinel-Mosaic is a Python-based toolkit designed to process and visualize Sentinel satellite imagery. It offers functionalities for resampling raster images, creating mosaics from multiple raster files, and drawing maps using Jupyter Notebooks.

Features
Raster Resampling: Adjust the resolution of raster images to suit specific analysis needs.

Raster Mosaicking: Combine multiple raster images into a single cohesive mosaic.

Map Visualization: Utilize Jupyter Notebooks to render and explore raster data interactively.

Repository Structure
raster_image_resample.py: Script for resampling raster images.

raster_mosiac.py: Script to create mosaics from multiple raster files.

map_draw.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for visualizing raster data on maps.
